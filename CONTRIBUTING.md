# Contributing to libfmp

The libfmp-package goes hand in hand with the FMP notebooks. In particular, we need to manually synchronize all libfmp-functions with text passages, explanations, and code in the FMP notebooks. Of course, we are happy for suggestions and contributions. However, to facilitate the synchronization, we would be grateful for either directly contacting us via email (meinard.mueller@audiolabs-erlangen.de) or for creating [an issue](https://github.com/meinardmueller/libfmp/issues) in our Github repository. Please do not submit a pull request without prior consultation with us.
